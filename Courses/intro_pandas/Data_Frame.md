# Pandas
The Pandas library is a Python library that provides data structures and data analysis tools. Pandas is built on top of the NumPy library, which provides efficient storage and manipulation of dense data arrays in Python. Pandas provides additional functionality on top of NumPy, including labeled axes, time series functionality, and tools for loading data from disk, among other things. Pandas is a very powerful library, and we will only scratch the surface of what it can do in this course. [For more information](https://pandas.pydata.org/).
